        Artifact 3: Adapting to Challenges — Learning from Biblical Leaders
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">Introduction:</div>
      <div>
        This artifact explores the theme of adaptive leadership through the lens
        of biblical figures who faced immense challenges. Their stories reveal
        how faith, courage, and wisdom enable leaders to navigate uncertainty
        and remain steadfast in their mission. Leadership is rarely predictable,
        and these examples show that adaptability is a vital skill rooted in
        both humility and trust in divine guidance.
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">
        Biblical Example 1: Moses — Leading Through Uncertainty
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Context:</div>
      <div>
        Moses was called to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, facing resistance
        from Pharaoh, fear among his people, and the challenges of the
        wilderness.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Adaptive Leadership in Action:</div>
      <div>
        Moses adapted by continuously seeking God’s direction through prayer and
        obedience. He learned to rely on divine wisdom instead of his own
        strength, showing that true leadership is not about control but about
        responsiveness to God’s guidance.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Lesson:</div>
      <div>
        Adaptability often requires surrender—recognizing that flexibility and
        faith go hand in hand when leading through uncertainty.
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">
        Biblical Example 2: Esther — Courage and Strategic Thinking
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Context:</div>
      <div>
        As queen, Esther faced a life-threatening decision: remain silent or
        risk her life to save her people from destruction.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Adaptive Leadership in Action:</div>
      <div>
        Esther sought God’s guidance through fasting and prayer, then approached
        the king with both courage and strategy. She demonstrated that faith
        does not mean passivity—it empowers leaders to act boldly and wisely.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Lesson:</div>
      <div>
        Adaptability is not only about reacting to change but also discerning
        the right time and method to act with faith-driven purpose.
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">
        Biblical Example 3: Nehemiah — Vision in the Face of Opposition
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Context:</div>
      <div>
        Nehemiah was tasked with rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem, encountering
        opposition and discouragement from every side.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Adaptive Leadership in Action:</div>
      <div>
        He reorganized his people, prayed for strength, and adjusted his methods
        while staying committed to the mission. Nehemiah’s resilience and
        flexibility allowed him to lead effectively despite external pressure.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Lesson:</div>
      <div>
        Visionary leaders adapt their strategies without compromising their

        Artifact 2: Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">Introduction:</div>
      <div>
        This artifact highlights two practical applications of machine learning
        (ML) and deep learning (DL), illustrating how each approach is suited to
        specific problem types and datasets.
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">
        Machine Learning Example: Email Spam Detection
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Algorithm:</div>
      <div>Logistic Regression (Simple ML)</div>
      <div className="font-bold">Real-World Application:</div>
      <div>
        Email providers like Gmail or Outlook use ML models to automatically
        classify incoming emails as spam or not spam.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Why This Approach is Suitable:</div>
      <div>
        The data is labeled (emails tagged as spam or not), making it ideal for
        supervised learning. Features such as word frequency, sender address,
        and presence of links can be manually defined and fed into the logistic
        regression model. The dataset size is manageable, making this approach
        efficient and effective.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Why Deep Learning is Not Suitable:</div>
      <div>
        Deep learning would be overkill because the features are
        straightforward, the dataset is moderate, and the computational cost
        would be higher without significant benefit.
      </div>

      <div className="font-bold mt-2">
        Deep Learning Example: Image Recognition
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Algorithm:</div>
      <div>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</div>
      <div className="font-bold">Real-World Application:</div>
      <div>
        Facial recognition systems in smartphones, airports, or social media
        platforms automatically identify faces from raw images.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">Why This Approach is Suitable:</div>
      <div>
        Input data is high-dimensional (raw pixels) and complex; manual feature
        engineering is impractical. CNNs automatically extract hierarchical
        features such as edges, textures, and facial structures through multiple
        layers. This approach is effective with large datasets typical in image
        recognition tasks.
      </div>
      <div className="font-bold">
        Why Simple Machine Learning is Not Suitable:
      </div>
      <div>
        Traditional ML methods like logistic regression or decision trees cannot
        efficiently handle raw pixel data or learn hierarchical features, making
        them ineffective for image recognition.
